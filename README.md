# ATS
ATS Resume Analyzer is a Streamlit-based AI application that performs OCR-driven resume parsing and ATS-style evaluation. The system converts PDF resumes into text using Poppler and Tesseract OCR, then analyzes the extracted content against a provided job description using Google Gemini 1.5 Flash. It generates structured insights including resume strengths, weaknesses, missing keywords, and an estimated ATS match percentage, enabling automated, data-driven resume screening.
